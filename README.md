📖 About the Project

Welcome to King County House Price Prediction!
This project uses the powerful XGBoost algorithm to predict house prices based on various features from the King County dataset.
The model is tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to achieve a high performance of R² = 90%.

> Note:
This machine learning model powers the Smart Web project — a full web application for house price prediction!
